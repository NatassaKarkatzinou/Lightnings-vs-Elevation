# A study of lightnings with focus on elevation

Discription

The data consisted of 20 years of observations (1995 - 2015) by the Lightning Imaging Sensor and elevations from
the 90 m resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission for tropics and subtropics. 
- Firstly, the top ten hot spots were located.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicated a seasonal variance. 
- K-means clustering revealed different types of groups based on the Flash Rate Density (FRD) and corresponding elevation. 
- Hierarchical clustering was performed in order to investigate the similarities in FRD density in a time series of monthly means over 20 years. 

In agreement with previous works, the present analysis reveals a positive correlation between FRD and elevations at some areas up to a certain height. Moreover, there are indications that there are areas with high FRDs which are not correlated to elevation but rather to large scale atmospheric processes happening in these areas.
